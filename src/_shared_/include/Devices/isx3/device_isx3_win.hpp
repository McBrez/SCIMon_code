   * The CreatePipeEx API is used to create an anonymous pipe I/O device.
   * Unlike CreatePipe FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED may be specified for one or
   * both handles.
   * Two handles to the device are created.  One handle is opened for
   * reading and the other is opened for writing.  These handles may be
   * used in subsequent calls to ReadFile and WriteFile to transmit data
   * through the pipe.
   * Taken from:
   * @link
   * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60645/overlapped-i-o-on-anonymous-pipe
   *
   * @param lpReadPipe Returns a handle to the read side of the pipe. Data may
   * be read from the pipe by specifying this handle value in a subsequent call
   * to ReadFile.
   * @param lpWritePipe Returns a handle to the write side of the pipe.
   * Data may be written to the pipe by specifying this handle value in a
   * subsequent call to WriteFile.
   * @param lpPipeAttributes An optional parameter that may be used to
   * specify the attributes of the new pipe.  If the parameter is not specified,
   * then the pipe is created without a security descriptor, and the resulting
   * handles are not inherited on process creation.  Otherwise, the optional
   * security attributes are used on the pipe, and the inherit handles flag
   * effects both pipe handles.
   * @param nSize Supplies the requested buffer size for the pipe.  This is
   * only a suggestion and is used by the operating system to
   * calculate an appropriate buffering mechanism.  A value of zero
   * indicates that the system is to choose the default buffering
   * scheme.
   *
   * @return TRUE - The operation was successful. FALSE/NULL - The operation
   * failed. Extended error status is available using GetLastError.
